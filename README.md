# Grocery-List-Java
This program allows a user to print, view, add, modify, remove and search for items in their grocery list. This program is a little more advanced than as it makes use of Linked Lists which was a data structure that I had not previously used a lot so making this was a good challenge for me.  The program gives the user 6 options which they can then pick through in order to construct and edit their list. As using Linked Lists was still fairly new to me I did use YouTube to help me with certain aspects of the program like the ModifyList method as well as the FindItem method. I believe this program highlights a solid understanding of data structures, iteration and the use of reusable components.
